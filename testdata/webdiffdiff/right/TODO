Move away from jsdifflib:
x Fixed layout with <div>s, "overflow:scroll" on each side.
x Only use red & green, no yellow "changed" color.
x Integrate highlight.js syntax highlighting
x Re-implement character-by-character diffs
x Synchronize horizontal scrolling.
- Re-implement "show more" links
- Factor out construction of line ranges for easier testing.
- Make scrolling not affect line numbers
- Move away from "contextSize" and to "minJumpSize".
- Fix one-sided diffs (shouldn't have a blank line on the other side).
- Factor out diff # of columns in a nicer way.
- Fix the escaping problem with "&&".

Misc:
x Put everything in an iframe with a "heartbeat" in the containing frame.
  Close the diff process when you close the tab.
- Set up a pip installer so that "pip install git-webdiff" works.
- Figure out what the "lindex" and "rindex" files are.
- Detect when it's run without "-d"
- Run "git config" on first run


Bugs:
- In this repo, run "git difftool -d -x webdiff 1a2f7c4^..1a2f7c4".
  - In diffview.js lines 173-174, the char-replace is off by 3 chars.
  - In app.py, line 198, the "H" on the left is green. The whole line should be.
  - There are some left sides missing.
