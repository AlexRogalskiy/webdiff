diff library changes:
- Factor out construction of line ranges for easier testing.
- Make scrolling not affect line numbers
- Move away from "contextSize" and to "minJumpSize".
- Factor out diff # of columns in a nicer way.
  -> also: use space more efficiently when full width won't fit. split left/right down the middle.
- Add a "selected diff" line

Misc:
- Figure out what the "lindex" and "rindex" files are.
- Include the "/4" in the URL for the containing frame (make refresh work).
- Make a "live demo" consisting of static content.


Bugs:
- In this repo, run "git webdiff 1a2f7c4^..1a2f7c4".
  - In app.py, line 198, the "H" on the left is green. The whole line should be.
  - In diffview.css, looks like we need a min-width.
- You can't run "webdiff testdata/webdiffdiff/{left,right}"
  -> should absolute-ize relative directories before os.chdir
