Move away from jsdifflib:
- Factor out construction of line ranges for easier testing.
- Make scrolling not affect line numbers
- Move away from "contextSize" and to "minJumpSize".
- Fix one-sided diffs (shouldn't have a blank line on the other side).
- Factor out diff # of columns in a nicer way.

Misc:
- Figure out what the "lindex" and "rindex" files are.
- Run "git config" on first run
- Include the "/4" in the URL for the containing frame (make refresh work).


Bugs:
- In this repo, run "git difftool -d -x webdiff 1a2f7c4^..1a2f7c4".
  - In app.py, line 198, the "H" on the left is green. The whole line should be.
  - In diffview.css, looks like we need a min-width.
- Horizontal scrolling is broken
